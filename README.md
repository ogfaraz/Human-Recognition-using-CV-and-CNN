# Human-Recognition-using-CV-and-CNN

## DESCRIPTION: 

Neural Network based model that have the ability to recognize Human or Objects by training the Model in Real-Time using Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Network.

- The model asks the number of objects/persons.
- The model asks the name and size of dataset that is going to be used for training.
- Collects the dataset photos by custom defining the size of the dataset.
- The model takes the given size of dataset by taking continuous photos of the person or object.

- After taking the photos, the model asks for the number of epochs/times you want to train it on the neural network.
- Give it some time for training.
- After the traing is completed.
- The model recognizes the person in real-time cam after the training.


## Use:

- Open Windows Powershell
- Choose the directory the files are stored in.
- Create a new python environment
- Run setup.py
- Now iteratively install the required modules using the pip command.
- After a few installation the program shall run.
- Yeah, That is all.
 Have Fun!
