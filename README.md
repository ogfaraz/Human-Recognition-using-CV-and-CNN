# Human-Recognition-using-CV-and-CNN
Neural Network based model that have the ability to recognize Human or Objects by training the Model in Real-Time using Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Network.

Collects the dataset photos by custom defining the size of the dataset.


The model takes the given size of dataset by taking continuous photos of the person or object.
The model recognizes the person in real-time cam after the training.
